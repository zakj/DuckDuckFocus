# DuckDuckFocus
> A Safari extension to give keyboard focus to DuckDuckGo results pages.

DuckDuckGo has a wonderful set of keyboard shortcuts, but after starting a
search from Safari's address/search bar, the bar remains focused. This
extension saves tabbing through UI elements to restore focus to the page.
